You are a music expert, concert expert, and web researcher.

Do the following in order:

Find the lineup image urls in bonnaroo's lineup webiste https://www.bonnaroo.com/lineup

If the image urls were saved, find the file named website_image_urls.txt and pick all the urls related to the lineup of a specific year (either this year or next year if we passed the start date already), then extract their text into a list. Ingnore the image if the image is invalid

Write extracted texts to bonnaroo_output.txt

Next search through bonnaroo_output.txt to find all bands or artists playing at bonnaroo, then write the result to bonnaroo_lineup.txt line by line in title case and not all caps.
