If lineup.txt already exists and is for the upcoming show (today's date is before the concert) then skip running tool and output "OK lineup.txt up to date".  Otherwise...

Search for the upcoming coachella lineup based on a specific year (either this year or next year if we passed it) and find the pitchfork.com page for it.  Search should look like "coachella lineup site:pitchfork.com"

Take that url, visit the page and save all the bands playing at coachella in lineup.txt.

Write all the bands you find into matches.txt. 

The matches.txt format will have band names separated by newline instead of comma and no more than 7 total.
