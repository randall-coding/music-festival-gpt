Do the following in order:

Find the lineup images in Glastonbury's lineup page based on a specific year (either this year or next year if we passed it). The search should look like "glastonbury line-up 2024 site:glastonburyfestivals.co.uk"

If the image or images were saved, find the images named website_glastonbury_$number located in the current directory and put their extracted texts into a list. Ingnore images when the image is invalid.

Write the combined extracted text to glastonbury_output.txt.

Next search through glastonbury_output.txt to find all bands or artists playing at glastonbury, then write the result to glastonbury_lineup.txt line by line in title case, not all caps.
